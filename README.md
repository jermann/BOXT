*Storage by Students for Students, enjoy your Summer worry free*


### About
This repo is the realization of our Software-as-a-Service class project to implement a startup idea. 

The software is deesigned as a storage marketplace where students can book stroage space to safely store their belongings over the Summer when they have to move out over the Dorm. It also allows students living off-campus with year long leases to list their space as storage to earn some income when they are not using the space.
